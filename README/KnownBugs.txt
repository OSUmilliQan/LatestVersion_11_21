Here, since the simulation is a work in progress, we list a number of features that you shouldn't trust.
Current development effort until the December 2016 meeting in NY is aimed at fixing these.


	* Everything associated with the Resistance, Gain, tCurrent, Charge, MaxWaveform, and Waveform 
	  and their units are currently likely numerically wrong. That said, all structures, classes, 
	  containers, calculations, etc in G4 simulation are coded. Minor changes will fix these.
	* There is currently nothing to retrieve the output of the simulation after the Online trigger
	* The simulation is not rhobust against changing number of stacks from 3 to something else, 
	  and changing number of pmts, scintillators, and their size (the shield is hardcoded, doesn't yet behave nicely)
	* dE/dx currently does not output smoothly.
	* Can't specify choice of particles in particles.ini 
	* DavidStuart.ini configurations currently doesn't work well
	* OSU setup currently doesn't work / is not specified
	* Total energy deposit is outputting nonsense
	* Can't choose triggering strategy in offline analysis
